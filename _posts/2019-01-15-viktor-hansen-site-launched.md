A quick and simple website made with tools such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). This site is made in order to have a single focal point where I can share small projects or thoughts.
I am considering rebuilding the site with [Angular](https://angular.io/) or some other framwork at a later point as practice, but since Jekyll is integrated in [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) it makes usefull for a quick minimum viable product.
