    <p>I have special interests in the reasoning behind information display. Since computers are deterministic by nature, this implies that the display of an array or sequence of events are rarely truly random. This matters when humans are interacting with a information systems since it shapes the userâ€™s experience, and by extension their future actions and behaviors.

        As a result my interest in Information Technologies are mainly found in the intersection between machine learning and information display(graphs, dashboards and to an extent front end, where these decisions are made).
